    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain Greek Yogurt, 1 1/2 cups</li>
        <li>3 Garlic Cloves, finely grated</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Dried Oregano or mint, 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs, patted dry, 2 lbs</li>
        <li>Mini Cucumbers, 1 1/2 lbs</li>
        <li>Tomatoes, 1 lb</li>
        <li>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Feta, crumbled, 4 oz</li>
        <li>Kalamata Olives, 1/2 cup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the yogurt and garlic;
            season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer 1/2 cup 
            of the yogurt to a medium bowl and reserve.
        </li>
        <li>Coat the chicken: To the large bowl, add the oregano and 
            stir to combine. Season the chicken all over with 1 1/2 tsp 
            salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the chickem to the large 
            bowl and turn to coat; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Start the salad: Smash the cucumbers with the side of your 
            knife until craggy and split. Rip into 1/2 - 1-inch pieces 
            and transfer to a colander placed in the sink. Slice or chop 
            the tomatoes into bite sized pieces. Add to the cucumbers along 
            with 1 1/2 tsp salt. (It may seem like a lot of salt, but most will 
            drain away.) Toss to combine and leave to drain.
        </li>
        <li>In a large nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, heat 
            the olive oil over medium. Scrape excess marinade off the chicken, 
            then cook the chicken in batches, adding oil to the pan if necessary, 
            until it's well browned and releases from the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip 
            and cook until cooked through, another 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to plates 
            to rest.
        </li>
        <li>To the medium bowl of yogurt, add the feta and mash with a fork until a chunky 
            paste forms. Shake the cucumbers and tomatoes to get rid of any excess moisture. 
            Add to the feta yogurt along with the olives and stir until coated. 
            Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
